## Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations of LLMs & AI Infrastructure
**Objective:** Understand LLaMA internals, transformers, tokenization, and training with PyTorch + Hugging Face.

**Outcomes:**
- Fine-tuned LLaMA-7B with QLoRA
- Built preprocessing pipelines for multilingual corpora

---

### Phase 2: Distributed Training at Scale
**Objective:** Scale training with DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, SLURM, and Azure Managed Lustre.

**Outcomes:**
- Trained models across multiple GPUs/nodes
- Used Lustre for parallel dataset streaming

---

### Phase 3: LLM Inference & Serving
**Objective:** Optimize and deploy LLaMA for production inference.

**Outcomes:**
- Served quantized models via vLLM and AKS
- Benchmarked performance and resource usage

---

### Phase 4: Monitoring & MLOps
**Objective:** Operationalize the end-to-end LLM lifecycle.

**Outcomes:**
- CI/CD for model updates
- Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
- Azure ML model registry & pipeline orchestration

---

### Phase 5: Real-World Projects
**Objective:** Apply all skills to domain-specific use cases in research and enterprise.

**Projects:**
- Domain-adapted LLaMA training
- Secure multi-tenant cluster setup
- Azure-integrated GenAI pipelines
